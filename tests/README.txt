ABSolve and ABSolCheck
=======================

ABSolve:
--------
ABSolve is a program that simulates a solver for the AB puzzle. It reads some information from the standard input (keyboard) and generates a solution for the puzzle. The way to use ABSolve can be obtained by invoking it without any parameters.

Usage:
$ ./ABSolve

Example:
$ ./ABSolve 5 <AB5 >Sol5

ABSolCheck:
-----------
ABSolCheck is a program that checks the solution generated by the ABSolve program. It reads some information from the standard input (keyboard) and verifies the correctness of the solution. The way to use ABSolCheck can be obtained by invoking it without any parameters.

Usage:
$ ./ABSolCheck

Example:
$ ./ABSolCheck 5 AB5 <Sol5

Note:
-----
Both programs read some information from the standard input (keyboard), but of course, that can be redirected.
